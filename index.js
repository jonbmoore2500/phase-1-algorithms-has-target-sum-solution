  the original solution described in solution section almost exactly matched my solution, so that was cool!
  the optimized solution with the Set or Object was interesting. I considered adding the values to an Obj to check later,
  but I didn't think about how it wouldn't actually be nested and I assumed it would still require O(n^2) so I didn't bother
